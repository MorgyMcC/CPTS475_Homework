# CPTS475_Homework
This repository features all of the homework from the WSU Cpts 475 course.

# Course Description
Data Science is the study of the generalizable extraction of knowledge from data. Being a data
scientist requires an integrated skill set spanning computer science, mathematics, statistics, and
domain expertise along with a good understanding of the art of problem formulation to engineer
effective solutions. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to this rapidly growing field
and equip them with some of its basic principles and tools as well as its general mindset. The
course will use the programming languages R (primarily) and Python.
# Topics to be covered include:
the data science process, exploratory data analysis, data wran-
gling, data visualization, linear regression, classification, clustering, principal component analysis,
time-series data mining overview, deep learning, and data and ethics.
The focus in the treatment of these topics is on breadth, rather than depth, and emphasis is placed
on integration and synthesis of concepts and their application to solving problems. Necessary
theoretical abstractions (mathematical and algorithmic) are introduced as and when needed.
